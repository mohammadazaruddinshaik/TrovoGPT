## 💡 Problem Statement: AMINOVERSE — ChatGPT for Proteins

### 🎯 Objective
Design a web application that takes a **human protein or gene** name as input and returns detailed biological insights, including:
- 🧬 **Biological function** (via UniProt)
- 🧩 **3D structure** (via PDB/AlphaFold)
- 💊 **Drug associations** (via DrugBank or ChEMBL)
- 🧫 **Linked diseases**
- 🔗 **Protein–protein interactions** (listed or visualized)
- 🧠 **Follow-up prompts** like “Tell me more about its disease links” or “Are there any known variants?”
